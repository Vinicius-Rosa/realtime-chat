# A real time chat with emojis! 🤯

Hi! How is it going? 😉
This project is a simple chat, nothing very innovative around here. But this is a good step for me in the backend's world. Cool stuffs I learned with this:
* NodeJS ~~(*Ok, i had an earlier base in NodeJS. But I improved it* 😑)~~
* Socket.io
* React Emojis 

So let's get down to business... 😎


## How to run

First, clone the repo:
> git clone https://github.com/Vinicius-Rosa/realtime-chat.git

> cd realtime-chat

#### The Server:
